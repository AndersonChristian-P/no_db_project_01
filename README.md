# To Do List Project (with No Database)

This project is part of my curriculum at [DevMountain](https://devmountain.com/)'s Web Development Immersive Program.

This project incorporates axios and express to embrace the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer). The HTTP methods used are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
